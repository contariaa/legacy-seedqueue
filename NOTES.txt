Vanilla Parity Concerns

/block

- DispenserBlock.random is actually just fully unused
- FallingBlock.instantFall
- FlowingFluidBlock#neighborSourceBlocks
- FurnaceBlock.keepInventory
- LeavesBlock.neighborBlockDecayInfo
- PumpkinBlock and SkullBlock BlockPatterns are initialized lazily
 - not an issue, might create multiple ones but it doesnt affect the final result if theyre created concurrently
- RedstoneWireBlock.wiresGivePower and affectedNeighbors
- StairsBlock#isRayTraced and StairsBlock#rayTracePass

/block/entity

- DispenserBlockEntity.RANDOM
 - not an issue since i dont think its possible for a dispenser/dropper to dispense during worldgen/the first tick
  - surely a mob cant spawn inside a jungle temple and instantly trigger it?
  - this is actually in 1.16.1 too
- EnchantingTableBlockEntity.RANDOM
 - same thing except it needs player input to even be used

/command

- AbstractCommand#commandProvider

/entity
- Entity.entityCount
 - this is already full of race-conditions because its not atomic and accessed by both client and server so thats fun

/entity/bossbar

- Bossbar
 - fully static but not an issue since its only used client-side

/item

- Item.RANDOM
 - only used to spawn particles and play sound
 - probably accessed from multiple threads anyway, should be fine
- PotionItem#STATUS_EFFECTS_1 and STATUS_EFFECTS_2
 - initialized lazily, candidate for CMEs

/server

- MinecraftServer#getServer
 - 127 usages...
- ServerNetworkIo.DEFAULT_CHANNEL, EPOLL_CHANNEL and LOCAL_CHANNEL
 - not sure if this being static is problematic, probably not
  - indeed not an issue, its just open to lan stuff

/structures
- StrongholdPieces.TOTAL_WEIGHT needs to be not static

/util

- FileIoThread.INSTANCE
- ItemScatterer.RANDOM
- RandomVectorGenerator.field_3660
- ScheduledTick.entries

/world/gen/feature
- BigTreeFeature
- FlowerPatchFeature
 - BiomeDecorator#generate uses #setFlowers

/world/chunk

- RegionIo.FORMATS

/world/biome

- SavannaBiome.ShatteredSavannaBiome, TaigaBiome and ExtremeHillsBiome#method_6420
 - change topBlock and baseBlock based on some parameters
- Biome#field_4631
 - see BigTreeFeature issues
- BiomeDecorator (and EndBiomeDecorator)
 - see Feature issues
 - lots of concerns
 - HugeMushroomFeature instance depends on one random call and then stays??
  - it sure does!
  - first time (once for mushroom island, once for mushroom shore) it generates a mushroom determines the type of mushroom it will always generate from then onwards
- MesaBiome
- IntArrayCache

Checked Directories

- command, server, world, block, entity, item, util
 - see concerns above
- structures
 - seems fine, structures are instantiated and stored in the Generators, which are per-world
- advancement, enchantment, inventory, recipe, scoreboard, stat, network
 - seems fine
