Vanilla Parity Concerns

/command

- AbstractCommand#commandProvider

/server

- MinecraftServer#getServer
 - 127 usages...
- ServerNetworkIo.DEFAULT_CHANNEL, EPOLL_CHANNEL and LOCAL_CHANNEL
 - not sure if this being static is problematic, probably not
  - indeed not an issue, its just open to lan stuff

/structures
- StrongholdPieces.TOTAL_WEIGHT needs to be not static

/world/gen/feature
- BigTreeFeature
- FlowerPatchFeature
 - BiomeDecorator#generate uses #setFlowers

/world/chunk

- RegionIo.FORMATS

/world/biome

- SavannaBiome.ShatteredSavannaBiome, TaigaBiome and ExtremeHillsBiome#method_6420
 - change topBlock and baseBlock based on some parameters
- Biome#field_4631
 - see BigTreeFeature issues
- BiomeDecorator (and EndBiomeDecorator)
 - see Feature issues
 - lots of concerns
 - HugeMushroomFeature instance depends on one random call and then stays??
  - it sure does!
  - first time (once for mushroom island, once for mushroom shore) it generates a mushroom determines the type of mushroom it will always generate from then onwards
- MesaBiome
- IntArrayCache

Checked Directories

- command, server, world
 - see concerns above
- structures
 - seems fine, structures are instantiated and stored in the Generators, which are per-world
- advancement, enchantment, inventory, recipe, scoreboard, stat
 - seems fine

Need to be checked

- block, entity, item, network, util
